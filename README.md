# Kleeneup (WIP)

Application for manipulating **finite automata**, **regular grammars** and **regular expressions**.

+ Reads, edits and saves regular grammars and regular expressions
+ Converts regular expressions to finite automata using De Simone's algorithm
+ Transforms regular grammars into finite automata and vice-versa
+ Determinizes and minimizes finite automata
+ Obtains finite automata that represent the intersection, difference or reverse of regular languages
+ Obtains regular grammars resulting from the union, concatenation and closure of regular grammars
+ Recognizes sentences accepted by a finite automaton and enumerates sentences of length n accepted by it
